            </div>
            <p>
              According to research, the human brain processes images much faster than text, making visual thinking a powerful tool for learning and understanding. Whether you're a professional, a student, or someone looking to improve your creativity, the Visual Thinking Workshop will help you tap into your brain's vast visual processing power.

              In the hands-on Visual Thinking Workshop, you'll learn and practice visual thinking by working through an actual book. In Cohort 4 we will read <a class="mylink" href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/54304159" target="_blank">Decoding Greatness by Ron Friedman</a>.
              I will guide you through the step-by-step process of</p>
            <p>

              The curriculum of the workshop is designed to provide hands-on learning experience on Visual Thinking. It consists of <b style="font-size: x-large;">6 two-hour online class sessions and 5 one-hour office hours</b>. The class sessions will cover topics in the curriculum, while the office hours will provide an opportunity to ask questions on a broader set of visual thinking, Excalidraw, productivity, and Obsidian-related topics. The class sessions will tentatively be held on Saturday afternoons <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/meetingtime.html?iso=20230527&p1=50&p2=248&p3=224&p4=152&p5=44" target="_blank" class="mylink">16:00 in Central European Time</a> (7:00am San Francisco, 12:00am Melbourne), while the office hours will be held on Sunday afternoons. The exact timing of all the workshop sessions will be agreed upon in the kickoff session.

              To enhance your learning experience, you will have access to a <b style="font-size: x-large;">Demo Obsidian Vault</b>, fully configured with plugins and scripts. The vault will contain session mind maps, walk-through videos, sample book-on-a-page summaries with full literature notes, and a wealth of other valuable content including many of my GTD and other Templater scripts. If you are interested in learning more about the Demo Vault, check out this <a href="https://youtu.be/p8vTC6IpvbE" class="mylink" target="_blank">video</a>.

              Additionally, you will have access to the <b style="font-size: x-large;">Visual Thinking Workshop Discord community</b> and videos on my <a class="mylink" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/VisualPKM" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>, which will support your learning journey.

            <p>
              To fully reap the benefits of the workshop, it's recommended to <b style="background-color: #e6d2c1;">dedicate about 6 to 10 hours per week</b>, as there will be plenty of homework between sessions. The reading and processing of a 300-page book will take time.
            </p>
            <p>
              The kickoff session is scheduled for <b style="background-color: #e6d2c1;">16:00 CET, May 27, 2023</b>. For a more detailed view of the session dates, topics, and workshop curriculum, please click on the image below:

            <p>
              If you're worried that you can't draw, don't be. I too struggle with sketching, but I've developed a range of tools and workflows to overcome my lack of drawing skills, which I will be sharing during the workshop.

            <p>
              If you have aspirations of becoming a visual storyteller, then this workshop will be an excellent opportunity for you. The skills you'll learn in visualizing important concepts and summarizing books into visual overviews will help you tell stories in a way that's supported by simple visuals.

            <p>
              If you're an avid reader, but you feel like you're only getting a fraction of the value out of the books you read, then this workshop is for you. By actively summarizing books and creating visual representations of the content, you'll deepen your understanding and recall of the book.

            <p>
              If you're looking for new ways to be creative, the effort of finding good visual representations of information is an excellent exercise in lateral thinking. If you're interested in lateral thinking, I have several articles on the subject on <a class="mylink" href="https://www.zsolt.blog/search/label/Algorithms%20of%20Thought" target="_blank">my blog</a>.

            <img src="images/Mouse.jpg" style="max-height: 100px; max-width: 100px;"/>
            <p>
              Although I sometimes prefer to draw with a stylus, I do most of my sketching with a mouse. If you have a pen and are good at quick sketches, then you can take advantage of that. However, if you don't have a stylus or you're not skilled with a pen, don't worry. A mouse is just as good an option.

            <p>
              If you're a business professional, this workshop is for you too. As a CIO in my "professional life," I use visual thinking tools and visual summaries every day, and these skills are just as essential for business as they are for personal use.

              I'm Zsolt Viczián, a seasoned engineer with over two decades of experience in problem-solving and cross-disciplinary knowledge. I bring a wealth of expertise to my work, having served in leadership roles at international companies for 20+ years and earned a Ph.D. from the Technical University of Budapest, as well as multiple Master's degrees in Electrical and Biomedical Engineering. As a lifelong learner and PMP-certified project manager, I'm always looking for new ways to expand my skills and knowledge.

              I love developing tools and integrations to optimize my personal and professional workflows. With my experience building tools like Excalidraw and ExcaliBrain within Obsidian, that can link drawings, images, and text, I'm confident that I can help you unlock your brain's visual processing power and boost your creativity through the Visual Thinking Workshop.

            <p>
              I'm always experimenting with new workflows and implementing my ideas into software. My visual thinking workflows and toolset have been rigorously tested and refined over the past 30 years, making them powerful solutions for your workflow. By joining the Visual Thinking Workshop, you'll benefit from my hard-earned experience and jumpstart your own journey, saving you time and effort.
