            According to some sources, the human brain processes images 60,000 times faster than text. Even if this estimate seems exaggerated, very few would debate that humans are visual creatures.

          <p>
            The best way to learn a new skill is by getting your hands dirty. In the workshop, we will learn and practice visual thinking by jointly working our way through an actual book that will be selected by the group.
            In the workshop I will work alongside you, creating my own summary of the book, and lead you through the step-by-step process of fully digesting the book.
            You will create literature notes,
          </p>
          <img class="img-fluid"  src="images/Literature-Notes.png"/>

          <p>  
            author your own book on a page summary,
          </p>
          <img class="img-fluid"  src="images/Book-on-a-page-sample.png"/>
          
          <p><br>
            and add visual permanent notes to your personal knowledge management system connecting these notes to your book on a page and to other notes in your knowledge graph.
            <img class="img-fluid"  src="images/Zettelkasten-cupboard.png"/>
          </p>
          
          
          <p>
            The visual summarization skills you'll learn and practice during the workshop will enable you to create visual summaries including strategic narratives, conference highlights, study notes for training courses, and more.

            </div>
          </div>
          <p>
            The workshop consists of 6 online sessions tentatively scheduled for Saturday afternoons <a class="mylink" href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Workshop+kickoff&iso=20221105T17&p1=50&ah=2">Central European Time</a>. The exact timing of the workshops will be agreed upon at the kickoff session.
          </p>
          <p>
            The sessions are supported by videos on my <a class="mylink" href="https://www.youtube.com/c/VisualPKM" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>. You'll find some examples of my videos further below.
          </p>
          <p>
            To get the most out of the workshop you'll need to commit about 6-10 hours per week as you'll have plenty of homework between sessions.

              <h4>You can't draw??</h4>
              <p>
                Don't worry, I can't draw either. I have developed a complete arsenal of tools and workflows to help me overcome my lack of sketching skills. I will share these during the workshop.

              <h4>Is your dream to be a visual storyteller?</h4>
              <p>
                Developing the skill to visualize important concepts and summarize books into visual overviews will go a long way in developing your skill to tell stories supported by simple visuals.
              </p>

            <div class="col mt-3">
              <h4>Are you reading books?</h4>
              <p>
                If you "just" read a book without putting in the effort of visually summarizing it, you're only getting a fraction of the value out of the book. I don't summarize every book, but the books I do, I internalize much stronger. The creative effort of coming up with visualizations, and organizing the content on the page so I can tell "my" story of the book deepens my understanding and recall of the book.

              <p>
                The effort of finding good visual representations is an excellent excercise in Lateral Thinking (the term invented by Edward de Bono). If you are interested in lateral thinking I have many articles on the subject on <a class="mylink" href="https://www.zsolt.blog/search/label/Algorithms%20of%20Thought" target="_blank">my blog</a>.

              <h4>You don't have a stylus?</h4>
              <p>
                While sometimes I prefer drawing with my stylus, I do the majority of my sketching with a mouse. If you have a pen and you are good at quick sketches you'll be able to capitalize on that. If you don't have a stylus, or you are not handy with a pen, don't worry, a mouse is just as good an option.

            My name is Zsolt Viczián. In my professional life, I am an engineer with well over 20 years of work experience, 15+ of which I have served in local, regional, and global leadership roles. I have a Ph.D. from the Faculty of Chemical Technology at the Technical University of Budapest and an MSc in Electrical Engineering, and another MSc in Biomedical Engineering. I hold a PMP from the Project Management Institute. I am a lifelong learner who enjoys using my cross-disciplinary knowledge to facilitate problem identification and solution delivery. In my free time, I enjoy programming, sketchnoting, writing, personal knowledge management, hiking, spelunking, mountain unicycling, traveling, and reading.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have always enjoyed hacking notetaking systems and dreamt of software like Excalidraw in Obsidian today where I'm able to link my handwritten sketches, drawings, and text seamlessly. In the past, I have avoided social media. I was using online forums but rarely contributed. 
          </p>  
          <p>  
            In 2020, during the pandemic I found myself stranded at home on a few weeks of unpaid leave. Being at home gave me time to reflect. I decided I would try and become more active on social media by first starting a blog, and then seeing where my road takes me. This is how I first learned to program Roam Research and integrated Excalidraw into Roam. Later, when I moved over to Obsidian I rebuilt my tools including the Excalidraw plugin and started a YouTube channel about Visual Personal Knowledge Management.
          </p>  
          <p>
            The tools I build as a hobby I also use on a daily basis for work. I love experimenting with new ways of working and enjoy the freedom of being able to implement my ideas into software that I can then use in my workflows. The visual thinking workflows and toolset that I have developed over the past years are battle-tested heavy-duty solutions. The Visual Thinking Workshop is now the next milestone on the journey I started at the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.
